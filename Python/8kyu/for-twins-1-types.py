#Describtion:
# Prolog:

# This kata series was created for friends of mine who just started to learn programming. Wish you all the best and keep your mind open and sharp!
# Task:

# Write a function that will accept two parameters: variable and type and check if type of variable is matching type. Return true if types match or false if not.
# Examples:

# 42, "int"    --> True
# "42", "int"  --> False

#Solution:
def type_validation(variable, _type): 
    return _type in str(type(variable))

#Other solutions:
def type_validation(variable, _type):

    return type(variable).__name__ == _type
