#Describtion:
# Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

# For example (Input --> Output):

# 39 --> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit, there are 3 multiplications)
# 999 --> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2, there are 4 multiplications)
# 4 --> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number, there is no multiplication)

#Solution:
def persistence(n):
    n = str(n)
    count = 0
    while len(n) > 1:
        p = 1
        for i in n:
            p *= int(i)
        n = str(p)
        count += 1
    return count

#Other solutions:
import operator
def persistence(n):
    i = 0
    while n>=10:
        n=reduce(operator.mul,[int(x) for x in str(n)],1)
        i+=1
    return i
