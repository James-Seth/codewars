//Describtion:
// There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

//     number of pillars (≥ 1);
//     distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
//     width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).

// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

//My Solution:
function pillars(numPill, dist, width) {
    return numPill > 1? (numPill - 2) * width + (numPill - 1) * dist * 100: 0
  }

//Other solutions:
function pillars(num_pill, dist, width) {
    if (num_pill < 2) return 0;
    const widthAllPillars = (num_pill - 2) * width;
    const distAll = (num_pill - 1) * (dist * 100);
    
    return distAll + widthAllPillars;
  }
